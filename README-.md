## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - I referenced this many times while working on this project. It is a life saver! I'd recommend it to anyone trying to grasp the concept that is grid.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1462360/css-hover-one-element-effect-for-multiple-elements) - This helped me figure out how to change the button colors while being hovered over without using JavaScript.
